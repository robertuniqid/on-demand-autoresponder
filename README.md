On Demand Auto Responder
=======================

Head Note : This script was created 1 year ago, it's still perfectly working and it's made under Bootstrap 2 for the "looks". If you have any suggestions please feel free to contact me.

This is a really quick way to setup a PHP Autoresponder to your under emails, after you've read & replied to all the regular emails, you can auto-respond to all the emails left behind and tell them what to do.

This process takes just a few seconds, and most importantly, it's going to "trigger" only on demand, works with any type of email address usign IMAP.
